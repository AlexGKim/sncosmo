About SNSim
===========


Relationship to other packages
------------------------------

SNSim is one of many software packages for Type Ia supernova analysis. Here is a comparison to some of them:

* `SNANA`_ is more a set of stand-alone self-contained applications, whereas SNSim is a programming library. 

* `SNooPy`_ (or snpy) is also a python library for SN analysis, but with a (mostly) different feature set. SNooPy is aimed at both the Python programmer and the general user (you don't necessarily need to know Python to use it), whereas SNSim is (currently) only a library for writing Python programs or scripts.
