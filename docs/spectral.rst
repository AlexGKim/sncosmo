Spectral operations
*******************

.. note:: `sncosmo` currently contains minimal functional, necessary
	  for basic o perations on spectra, such as redshifting and
	  synthetic photometry. This functionality is planned for
	  eventual inclusion in :mod:`astropy`, at which point,
	  `sncosmo` can use that functionality instead.


Here are the built-in bandpasses:
