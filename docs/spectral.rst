Spectral operations
*******************

.. note:: `sncosmo` currently contains minimal functional, necessary
	  for basic operations on spectra, such as redshifting and
	  synthetic photometry. This functionality is planned for
	  eventual inclusion in `astropy`, at which point,
	  `sncosmo` can use that functionality instead.
