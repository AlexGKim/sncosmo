Relationship to other packages
==============================

SNSim is one of many software packages for Type Ia supernova analysis.
The most prominent package used for simulation of Type Ia surveys is
`SNANA`_, Unlike SNSim, SNANA is a stand-alone, self-contained
application.  This can be an attractive feature for users without much
programming experience, but others may find it constraining.
