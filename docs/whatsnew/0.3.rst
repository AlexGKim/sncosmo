What's New in sncosmo 0.3 (unreleased)
======================================

* registry is now case-independent. All of the following now work::

      sncosmo.get_magsystem('AB')
      sncosmo.get_magsystem('Ab')
      sncsomo.get_magsystem('ab')

* Photometric data can be unordered in time. Internally, the data are
  sorted before being used in fitting and typing.
