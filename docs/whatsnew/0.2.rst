=========================
What's New in sncosmo 0.2
=========================

* Added SN 2011fe Nearby Supernova Factory data to built-in models as
  ``'2011fe'``

* ``sncosmo.plotlc``: Ability to plot model synthetic photometry
  without observed data, using the syntax
  ``sncosmo.plotlc(model=model, bands=['band1', 'band2'])``

* Photometric data format is now more flexible.
