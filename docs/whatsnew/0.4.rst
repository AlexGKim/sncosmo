====================
What's New in v0.4.0
====================

This is an entirely backwards-incompatible release, due to changes in the way
models are defined.

* ``ObsModel`` is now the main class used throughout the package. An
  ``ObsModel`` instance consists of exactly one ``SourceModel`` and
  zero or more ``PropagationEffect`` instances. The ``ObsModel`` keeps
  track of the redshifts of the source and the effects. Previously all
  this functionality was contained in a single class inheritance. The
  new system makes it easy and natural to add effects such as host
  galaxy or Milky-way dust to arbitrary source models, and keeps things like
  redshift and observer-frame time separated from the models for sources.

* Many other changes yet to be detailed.
