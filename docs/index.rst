Features
--------

SNCosmo makes it easy to work with empirical supernova models
(models of spectral evolution as a function of time). Some features:

- normalize flux to desired absolute magnitude
- extract a spectrum at arbitrary time, wavelength values
- redshift models
- Models include extinction
- generate synthetic photometry
- Many built-in models, such as Hsiao, Nugent, SALT2, PSNID
