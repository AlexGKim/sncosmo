SNCosmo is a python library for supernova cosmology. It provides a
class for empirical supernova models, allowing you to extract things
like the model phase coverage, wavelength coverage, spectra and
synthetic photometry using a common interface for several different
types of models. For example usage, see :doc:`models`.
