SNSim Documentation
===================

SNSim is a python package for simulating astrophysical transient
surveys. It includes utilities for interacting with several types of
supernova models. Although it was written mainly for simulating
supernova surveys, it can be used to simulate the detection of any
transient that has a defined spectral time-series template.

It depends on NumPy_ and `AstroPy <http://www.astropy.org>`_.
